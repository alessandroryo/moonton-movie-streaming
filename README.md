## Moonton Movie Streaming

Moonton is a movie streaming platform built using the Laravel framework. Laravel is a popular PHP framework that is designed to make it easier for developers to create web applications.

On Moonton, users can browse and stream a variety of movies. The platform likely has a database of movies that are stored on a server, and users can access this database through the Moonton website. When a user selects a movie to watch, the platform streams the movie to the user's device in real-time.

The Laravel framework provides Moonton with a number of tools and features that make it easier to build and maintain the platform. For example, Laravel includes a built-in authentication system, which can be used to manage user accounts and secure user data. It also has tools for handling tasks such as routing, database management, and caching, which are important for a streaming platform like Moonton.
